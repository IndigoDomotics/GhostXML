Usage: from curlcodes import codes as curl_code

Import into plugin.py and reference curl code message as
a standard dict.  I.e.,

    code = curl_code.get('-99', "Unknown code.")
    self.logger.warning(code)

These codes should allow for more human-friendly logging for users.

            messages were lifted from the curl man page dated 2016-11-16.
